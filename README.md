# Shapy Builder

Hi! This is the **Shapy Builder**, the cutest thing in the galaxy!

The purpose of this app and repo is to demonstrate different ways that state can be managed in React. The same Shapy Builder app has been implemented multiple times with different state management systems so we can see what the code looks like and what paradigms are adopted.

Currently, this repo demonstrates:

* React Context API and Hooks
* MobX and Observables
* Redux and Dispatching Actions
